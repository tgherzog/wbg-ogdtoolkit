The World Bank also has several initiatives and programs that use Open Data to address specific challenges:


* **[Open Data for Resilience Initiative](https://www.gfdrr.org/opendri)** (OpenDRI). OpenDRI applies Open Data concepts
to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. OpenDRI supports World Bank Regional
Disaster Risk Management Teams to build capacity and long-term ownership of Open Data projects with client countries and
partners, tailored to meet stakeholder needs. <cite>Its complementary programs include data sharing through GeoNode, a free,
open-source platform that provides technical solutions and assistance; community mapping, which utilizes collaborative
crowd-sourcing mapping tools such as OpenStreetMap to engage communities to create accurate, timely data about urban and
rural environments; and risk communication, which utilizes InaSAFE software to assess the likely effects of future
disasters by combining data from scientists, governments and communities and to communicate risk more effectively
to decision-makers in planning, preparedness and response.</cite>

* **[World Bank Group Finances](https://finances.worldbank.org)** (WBGF). The WBGF program uses open financial data [via
the web](https://finances.worldbank.org) and [mobile devices](http://financesapp.worldbank.org/about/) to promote
transparency,
expand the use of data analytics, support innovation and new businesses and address development challenges. <cite>The program
provides three key services: Guidance in opening financial data and engaging communities and stakeholders in the use of
data for policymaking, including [demand analysis](https://www.scribd.com/book/232433281/Open-Financial-Data);
development of data-driven tools to help agencies use Open Data to deliver services more effectively; and support for
the private sector to promote economic growth and social impact. WBGF also provides mobile strategy consulting to help
clients connect with users via point-to-mobile apps. For more information, please contact <finances@worldbank.org> or
<ogdtoolkit@worldbank.org>.</cite>

* **Open Transport.** The next generation of tools for managing and planning transport systems in resource-constrained
environments, Open Transport addresses three principles: Open Data standards; open source software; and
support for the development of transit application to achieve significantly greater use of available data.
<cite>It provides three critical services for evidence-based transport planning and management: Data collection; data
storage, management and sharing; and data analysis and visualization.</cite>

* [BOOST](http://go.worldbank.org/UX0PVF5YM0). A comprehensive public spending database established in 57
countries, the BOOST initiative is a Bank-wide collaborative effort to facilitate access to budget data, help build open
budgets and improve decision-making processes, transparency and accountability. <cite>The BOOST platform uses government data
and a 26-digit template to make highly granular fiscal data easier to understand and accessible to key users such as
legislatures and civil society. Expenditure data are distributed on core fiscal dimensions (i.e., administrative, function,
economic, fund sources, economic type) and can be linked with additional datasets to support broader efficiency and
equity analyses. For more information, contact Leif Jensen at <ljensen2@worldbank.org>.</cite>

* [The Open Aid Partnership (OAP)](http://www.openaidmap.org). The OAP is a multi-stakeholder initiative housed in the
World Bank Group’s Innovation Labs. The OAP brings together governments, development partners, civil society and media
groups to collectively improve aid transparency and effectiveness. <cite>Key objectives of the OAP are to build the capacity
of in-country partners to collect, curate and publish data on development resources in an open and accessible format,
and to use the data to engage citizens and other stakeholders in evidence-based conversations on development. For more information, visit <http://openaidmap.org>, or contact <openaid@worldbank.org>.</cite>

* [Data on Company Registries](http://www.ocr.gov.np/index.php/en/) (OCR). As part of a long-term partnership, the
World Bank Group's International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Office of the Company Registrar (OCR) in Nepal
implemented a new e-Services system that facilitates registration for entrepreneurs and companies. <cite>The automated
database and digital filing system computerizes the process involved in opening a business and provides benefits that
include streamlined filing of annual reports; integration of business and tax registration; and publication of a
business registration user guide. The success of this project has created demand at two more Nepalese agencies -- the
Departments of Industry and Commerce and Supply Management -- to implement similar reforms. For more information,
contact <opengovdata@worldbank.org>.</cite>

* **Open Data in Health.** In many countries, public health is one of the easiest sectors of data to open and use to
improve policy and decision-making. Open Data in Health provides readiness assessments to mobilize stakeholders and
policymakers to understand the value of government health data, improve access to it and use it to improve health
services policy. <cite>Because journalists and the media play a key role in explaining Open Data to citizens and motivating
governments and data owners to open it, Open Data in Health offers data literacy programs to explain relevant issues in
the health sector, how to interpret health data and how the media can use Open Data in their work, as well as to help
them identify data sources. For more information, contact <ogdtoolkit@worldbank.org>.</cite>

* [Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Map](http://www.gafspfund.org/gafspmapglobal) (GAFSP). 
The GAFSP Coordination Unit and Innovation Labs developed an Open Data Mapping Platform to address the underfunding of
agricultural and food security assistance by helping countries scale up their strategic investment plans. <cite>The platform
features easy-to-understand geographic visuals, including maps, photos and videos, to improve communication with
stakeholders and support the monitoring process, as well as increase transparency, social responsibility, beneficiaries’
engagement and targeting of interventions. Global maps present eligible countries, countries with active projects and
funding by country or region. Country maps pinpoint areas selected for interventions and present general indicators,
such as poverty or malnutrition, and project-specific indicators, such as irrigated areas. The initiative also provides
geography-based case studies about projects and their local impacts.</cite>

* [Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative](https://eiti.org) (EITI). A coalition of governments, companies
and civil society, the EITI advocates openness into the way countries manage natural resources, such as oil, gas and
metals. Countries implementing the EITI Standard commit to full disclosure of revenue from natural resources. <cite>The World
Bank EITI team helps EITI member countries translate data disclosure into greater effectiveness and accountability
around exploitation of resources. The team addresses data supply and quality issues across ministries, as well as
demand-side use, working with oversight bodies and civil society regarding capacity building, hackathons, visualizations
and creating feedback loops on issues raised by data. The effort will aid interoperability across different parts of
government, between contracting parties and civil society, and between the private sector and its government
counterparts. For more information, contact <opengovdata@worldbank.org>.</cite>

* [The Open Landscape Partnership Platform](http://openlandscape.info) (OLPP). The OLPP is a high-resolution
crowd-mapping platform that supports globally consistent and locally relevant cross-sectoral collaborations for design,
monitoring and evaluation of projects that impact sensitive landscapes, critical habitats and hotspots. <cite>Initially
developed in partnership with the [World Bank Global Tiger Initiative](http://globaltigerinitiative.org), it is a joint
initiative of satellite data providers, distributors, value-added processors and end users who are creating a community
of practice to expand demand for open access to very high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data. This data is
suitable for wide-ranging non-profit use in the interest of public accountability, transparency and sustainability of
land and natural resource management and conservation practices.</cite>

* [Open Parks Network](https://openparksnetwork.org) (OPN). OPN serves the global parks community by providing
information, tools and solutions to support the stewardship of natural and cultural assets of protected areas. It unites
managers, researchers, policymakers and citizens through development of cyber-infrastructure that freely distributes
data to facilitate more informed, science-based management decisions. <cite>Clemson University, a public Land-Grant
University, owns OPN and created a digital repository of the World Bank Global Tiger Initiative's
[document library](https://openparksnetwork.org/index.php/component/search/?searchword=***&ordering=newest&searchphrase=any&limit=20&areas[0]=GTIDocs),
comprised of more than 300,000 photos, maps, manuscripts and other items held at archives and museums of U.S. parks,
protected areas and historic sites. GTI and Clemson are building an Open Data platform to support the efforts of Tiger
Range Nations to double the world's tiger population.</cite>

* **World Bank Global Media Development Program.** This partnership-driven program provides a range of services to support
Data Literacy, including sustained training for media practitioners on the potential and value of government data. The
program recognizes journalists, editors, media owners, civic coders, bloggers, social media leaders and technologists as
crucial users and re-users of government data, as well as key entry points for the general public's consumption and
analysis of data. <cite>Its Data Literacy methodology addresses the deep capacity gaps in target users and beneficiaries of
Open Data by growing "pipelines" for capacity development between data sources and public media platforms. It also
integrates media practitioners into communities of practice with government and non-government stakeholders, who are
working to improve the environment for free and open information, which will enhance government transparency and
accountability as well as data-driven decision-making at all levels.</cite>

* **Open Data for Social Accountability and Citizen Engagement.** This program supports opportunities to use Open Data
initiatives to move beyond a focus on transparency, and towards the use of such initiatives by citizens in social
accountability and citizen engagement approaches. <cite>Open Data for Social Accountability and Citizen Engagement
collaborates with other Bank units to provide comprehensive support to Open Data initiatives at the country and project
levels. Noteworthy examples include India, where Open Data-enabled citizen engagement solutions for rural development
are being considered, and Nepal, where the gender-based violence hackathon was delivered. The program has also supported
initiatives in Jamaica, Kyrgyz Republic, Nigeria, Russia and Rwanda. For more information, contact
<skumagai@worldbank.org>, or <opengovdata@worldbank.org>.</cite>
