title: Starting an Open Data Initiative
---

This section provides some of the tools that governments will need to take the first steps in an
Open Data initiative. It is intended for public sector managers and staff who have been tasked with
coordinating or organizing an Open Data initiative.

As planning for an Open Data initiative takes shape and the number of participants expands,
other sections of this toolkit will become relevant to various roles, including
[technology management](technology.html), [user engagement](demand.html), and [data production](supply.html).
In the very early stages of planning, [technical support](technical-support.html) and the [Open Data Readiness
Assessment](odra.html) are also relevant.


Benefits of Open Data {#benefits}
=====================


As with any public initiative, Open Data involves some expenditure of public resources and effort. As such, public
officials are often interested in the benefits of Open Data compared to the levels of required effort.

Similar to other global commodities, data has significant potential to provide benefits. In fact, data has been [referred to as the new
oil](http://www.forbes.com/sites/perryrotella/2012/04/02/is-data-the-new-oil), because while both data and oil have intrinsic value, they both must be "refined" or otherwise transformed to realize their full potential. When government
data are made accessible and re-usable, they enable individuals, organizations and even governments themselves to
innovate and collaborate in new ways.

From accelerating economic growth to ensuring government accountability, Open Data can benefit citizens, organizations -- and the governments themselves.

Broadly speaking, the benefits of Open Data include:


* **Transparency.** Open Data supports public oversight of governments and helps reduce corruption by enabling greater
  transparency. For instance, Open Data makes it easier to monitor government activities, such as tracking public budget
  expenditures and impacts. It also encourages greater citizen participation in government affairs and supports democratic
  societies by providing information about voting procedures, locations and ballot issues.

* **Public Service Improvement.** Open Data gives citizens the raw materials they need to engage their governments and
  contribute to the improvement of public services. For instance, citizens can use Open Data to contribute to public
  planning, or provide feedback to government ministries on service quality.

* **Innovation and Economic Value.** Public data, and their re-use, are key resources for social innovation and economic growth. Open Data
  provides new opportunities for governments to collaborate with citizens and evaluate public services by giving citizens access to
  data about those services. Businesses and entrepreneurs are using Open Data to better understand potential markets and
  build new data-driven products.

* **Efficiency.** Open Data makes it easier and less costly for government ministries to discover and access their own data or data from
  other ministries, which reduces acquisition costs, redundancy and overhead. Open Data can also empower citizens with the
  ability to alert governments to gaps in public datasets and to provide more accurate information.

  This report cites three potential solutions in which the release and re-use of Open Data could help curb government
  corruption and bureaucracy: By identifying the different types of corruption in various sectors; by suggesting
  relevant data that should be released in a particular context; and by demonstrating best practices of information and
  data re-use to provide transparency in these sectors.


Open Data Policies {#policies}
==================


Open Data policies serve two groups of users: Governments and other "supply-side" organizations, and
citizens and other data consumers. Each group gains distinct benefits and assistance from Open Data policies.
For governments, ministries and supply-side organizations, policies provide guidance, instructions, requirements and tools
for implementing Open Data. Policies often spell out which types of data may **not** be considered open and why, and how
to safeguard sensitive information. They may also establish governance of the Open Data initiative, describe
inter-agency working groups and provide points of contact.

For user groups comprised of citizens, civil society organizations, businesses, researchers, and data consumers, Open Data policies clearly define which data
are or will be made public, how and where to acquire data, standards for providing data and metadata (which also
foster accountability) and how to engage with the government or producing agency. 

Policies aid both data consumers and data producers by clearly outlining the standards, processes and requirements for offering and acquiring public information.
{: .pullquote :}

An additional benefit of Open Data policies is the insight they provide into a government's internal procedures for
managing the Open Data initiative, which helps consumers better understand the data ecosystem. Since governments are
often important consumers of their own data, Open Data policies can be helpful to governments from the standpoint of
both the consumer and producer.

## Guidance on Open Data Policies

* [8 Principles of Open Government Data](http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles). These principles were first
established by open government advocates in 2007. <cite>In short, they state that government data can be considered
open if they are made available in a form that is complete; primary; timely; accessible; machine processable;
non-discriminatory; non-proprietary; and license free.</cite>

* [UK Open Data White Paper: Unleashing the
Potential](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/CM8353_acc.pdf). Published in 2012, this paper
presents a detailed approach to the U.K.'s plan to unlock the potential of Open Data. <cite>The plan consists of three general
steps: Enhancing access to and strengthening data usability; building trust in public data; and providing smarter, more
effective capabilities to use and share data. Objectives and potential outcomes of the plan include getting more data
into the public domain and ensuring that data are accurate, shared responsibly and easy to use and obtain.</cite>

* [Australian Gov 2.0 Taskforce
Report](http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/gov20taskforcereport/doc/Government20TaskforceReport.pdf). This report,
published in 2009, presents Australia's plan to integrate Web 2.0 collaborative technologies, communities and tools into
government policy, service delivery and regulation issues. <cite> Called Government 2.0, this approach to governing helps
public agencies become more responsive, innovative and citizen-centric, as well as open and accountable. One of its
three central objectives is allowing open access to public sector information, and exploiting the full social and
economic value of this information as a national resource managed for public purposes.</cite>

* [Open Government Guide](http://www.rcfp.org/open-government-guide) (Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press).
This is a compendium of information on U.S. state laws that address the disclosure of open records and attendance at
open meetings. <cite>Organized into two parts (e.g., access to records and access to meetings), it details the rights of
reporters and other citizens to see information such as police records and voting results, and to attend official
meetings, including those of state and local governments. The Open Government Guide makes it easy to compare laws across
U.S. states and the District of Columbia.</cite> 

* [New Zealand's Journey to Open Data](http://www.slideshare.net/enotsluap/i2012-paul-stone-slides-not-seen). This
presentation, produced in 2012, provides guidance to New Zealand government agencies about releasing copyrighted and
non-copyrighted materials for re-use by third parties. <cite>In 2011, public service departments were directed by a
declaration to release high-value public data for re-use, in accordance with Open Data principles. High-value data are
those with economic and social, transparency and democratic, and/or efficiency outcomes.</cite>

steps to building an effective Open Data program. <cite>These include: 1. Start with small, easy datasets; 2. Focus on promoting
transparency; 3. Ask the development community for insights on data usefulness and accessibility; 4. Increase internal
participation and get colleagues on board; 5. Optimize for efficiency and save time and money; and 6. Share and pool
data with neighboring cities, states and countries for additional benefits.</cite>

This report, published in 2012 by [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com), examines the openness of companies
in [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) countries. <cite>OpenCorporates asserts that the world is
increasingly dominated by interconnected global companies and that open access to key information, including core
datasets that affect our lives, is a fundamental principle of free markets and democracy. It notes that many companies restrict access
to information, which impacts the ability of stakeholders, employees and society at large to understand and
influence companies and hold them accountable, and enables the potential for corporate corruption.</cite>

* [OECD: Open Government Data - Towards Empirical Analysis of Open
  Government Data Initiatives](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/open-government-data_5k46bj4f03s7-en). This paper
  explores the principles, concepts and criteria of open government data (OGD) initiatives and the challenges to their
  implementation at central and local levels of government. <cite>Authored by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development, it outlines a methodology to analyze the value of OGD initiatives, provides an analytical
  framework for the initiatives and recommends data to be collected across OECD countries. Applying the framework and
  collecting data could lead to the development of a common set of metrics with which to assess OGD impacts and value
  creation within and across countries.</cite>

* [Sunlight Foundation: Guidelines for Open Data Policies](http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/opendata/). These policy
guidelines include recommendations on what data should be made public, how to make it public and how to implement
policy. <cite>Topics addressed include guidance on what an Open Data policy can and should do when the objective is to create
a government data ecosystem where Open Data is the default. Setting a data default to "open" indicates that a government
is proactive about making public information available online and without barriers for re-use, and about making decisions
in the public interest.</cite> 

* [Briefing on Open Data Policy Declarations](../docs/briefing-on-open-data-declarations-generic.doc). A "policy declaration" is intended
to provide a clear signal of political intent on the part of a government in relation to an Open Data initiative. This
briefing provides background and considerations for the formulation of Open Data policy declarations.
