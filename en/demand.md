title: Demand and Engagement
---


Central and local governments around the world are increasingly opening
data and making them available for free, often as part of continuing
efforts to further the reality of open government. While this has
resulted in approval from development practitioners, government sponsors
and technologists, the general public has not been widely engaged in the
effort. As a result, the level of informed public debate on data-driven
issues---from budgets, to service delivery, to the practical
effectiveness of donor aid---is low, even in many of the "opened"
sectors.

Increasing the level of awareness of Open Data and its potential value
is of particular interest to government agencies, civil society
organizations, technologists and journalists. As data are opened,
however, capturing the attention and imagination of the full spectrum of
data users and consumers remains a challenge. How do we engage the other
side---the demand side---of the Open Data phenomenon? How can we grow
communities of data users and encourage data "ownership" by the media,
community groups, NGOs, labor unions, professional associations,
universities and others?

Realizing the full benefits of data use also means engaging civic
hackers, also known as programmers and developers. Because data-driven
products, apps, and content can improve quality of life, the global
movement by developers to reclaim the term "hackers" and emphasize their
positive contributions to civil society is gaining wider acceptance.

When assessing engagement strategies and activities, the level of
readiness of an Open Data initiative and the data literacy of its users
are primary factors to consider. To engage a variety of stakeholders as
an Open Data program develops, the following strategy addresses both the
readiness level and the initiative's audience, and may help inspire and
empower citizens to use Open Data and maximize value to the public in
practical ways. The strategy is comprised of four stages: Early
Engagement, Capacity Development, Use & Re-use and Further
Development.

## Stage 1: Early Engagement {#stage-1}

During the early stage, engagement strategies focus on identifying key
data providers and consumers and encouraging them to take the first
critical steps towards an Open Data initiative. On the provider side,
engagement might mean identifying data managers in key government
ministries and agencies; sometimes government staff need help
understanding what data they already have. On the consumer side,
engagement strategies might identify organizations that have both the
incentive and the means to use Open Data immediately. For both
audiences, early engagement often entails growing awareness of the use,
benefits and opportunities presented by Open Data; identifying
priorities and data demands for different audiences; building capacity;
and supporting Open Data communities that already exist. The following
events and programs are examples of effective Stage 1 strategies:

* **Open Data Sensitization Workshops.** Designed for a variety of
  audiences, these events provide an overview of Open Data best
  practices and benefits, along with insights from countries, regions
  and partners about their experiences. One example is the [Open Data
  Stakeholder Engagement
Workshop](http://commtech.gov.ng/index.php/videos/news-and-event/128-fg-kicksoff-opendata-initiative), which was held
during the January
  2014 announcement of Nigeria's Open Data Initiative.
* **The Business Case for Open Data Roundtable.** This high-level
  roundtable introduces the benefits of Open Data for social, economic
  and private sector growth and development, and attempts to catalyze
  leadership on both supply and demand sides. Information provided at
  this roundtable is customized for groups of
  decision-makers---including ministerial officials, local government
  leaders, CEOs, media owners, directors of civil society organizations
  and more---and twinned with support opportunities from the Bank and
  its close partners, such as the Data Literacy Bootcamp detailed in
  Stage 2. Examples include [Media Leaders Roundtables on 'Open Data and
  the Future of News'](http://allafrica.com/stories/201201300873.html) held in Ghana, Kenya, Nepal, Tanzania and
  South Africa.
* **Data Liberation Scrape-a-thon.** A two-day program that convenes
  international coders and sources local civic coders to collect
  existing, unstructured government data, re-structure them in
  machine-readable formats (e.g., CSV) and use them to populate a
  nascent or temporary Open Data platform. The program provides an
  opportunity to gain traction on the early Open Data process by
  capitalizing on what's already available and leveraging it to build
  momentum toward further opening by individual ministries. One such
  program supports the [Hacks/Hackers Open News Scrape-a-thon in
  Chile](http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersChile/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=15810502), where "scraped" data is
hosted for free on civically owned
  and communally managed repositories, such as [OpenAfricaData.org](http://africaopendata.org/)
  and [OpenDataLatinoAmerica.org](http://www.opendatalatinoamerica.org/home/).

## Stage 2: Capacity Development {#stage-2}

For any data to be useful, consumers must develop "data literacy"\: They
must understand data, how to acquire data and how to apply data to
specific needs. Stage 2 engagement strategies increase data literacy and
technical capacity among potential users, including journalists,
non-profit organizations, academics and software developers. The degree
and style of technical training depends on the audience. Ideally,
consumers would take part in multiple training opportunities as their
needs require, and connect to [local interest groups and communities of
practice](#stage-4). The following courses and workshops address these
objectives:

* **Open Data Literacy Bootcamps.** These intensive three-day
  "learn-by-doing" workshops focus on core skills development for
  journalists, civil society and civic coders. Each participant is
  assigned a desktop computer in a classroom for hands-on, guided
  practicals. Sessions include demonstrations of Open Data catalogs;
  training on Excel/spreadsheets and creating pivot tables; scraping
  local county and national data; cleaning this data; creating
  visualizations; an introduction to GIS mapping; and ultimately
  crafting narratives around data, including an introduction to building
  apps and action plans. Example engagements include Data Literacy
  Bootcamps in  [India](http://delhi.dbootcamp.org/), [Mexico](http://mexico.dbootcamp.org/),
[Singapore](http://singapore.dbootcamp.org/), [South
  Sudan](http://southsudan.databootcamp.org/),
[Sudan](http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/stories/helping-sudans-media-follow-money), 
[Bolivia](http://bolivia.databootcamp.org/), [Ghana](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcampghana/home-1),
  [Jordan](http://jordan.databootcamp.org/), [Nepal](http://nepal.databootcamp.org/),
[Malawi](http://malawi.databootcamp.org/),
[Moldova](http://www.opendta.org/Pages/Events/Moldova-Innovation-Week-2012--Open-Development-Technology-Alliance.aspx),
[South
  Africa](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcampsa/), [Tanzania](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcamptz/),
[Tunisia](https://sites.google.com/site/databootcamptunisia/), [Ethiopia](http://ethiopia.dbootcamp.org/),
  [Venezuela](http://ipysvenezuela.org/2013/10/18/boot-camp-en-periodismo-de-datos/) and
[Uruguay](http://uruguay.dbootcamp.org/).
* **Open Data Master Classes.** These classes provide intensive
  multi-week, bootcamp-style training for mid-career demand-side
  practitioners, which dives even deeper into data literacy experiential
  learning and skills building with data analysis.
* **E-Learning on Open Data Literacy**. This weeks-long Open Data
  literacy e-learning course will launch in 2015 and demonstrate an even
  broader array of data literacy tools. It will be offered as both a
  facilitated and self-guided course to maximize utility for a broad
  audience. The courses will be free, open source and made available on
  multiple e-learning platforms.

## Stage 3: Use & Re-use {#stage-3}

The objective of Stage 3 is to harness Open Data in specific ways to
address particular challenges and opportunities, and use Open Data to
generate tangible value and results. Governments may already have policy
priorities for which they are looking for solutions involving Open Data,
and engagement at this stage can be designed to develop the beginnings
of those solutions. In other cases, the private sector may have its own
ideas and the goal may be to simply encourage innovation towards any
public purpose imaginable. The following events and engagements target
specific challenges and attempt to identify appropriate solutions:

* **Utility Hackathons.** Utility hackathons are organized around
  particular development challenges where data has already been
  surfaced, such as through data liberation scrape-a-thons.
  Technologists typically use existing data to develop and build utility
  apps that solve development problems, with an emphasis on public
  service delivery. Winners may receive seed grants to build out and
  deploy utility apps and may be offered post-hackathon mentoring and
  advice to accelerate development/deployment and---more
  importantly---repurpose those utility apps in other country/regions to
  meet analogous needs. Examples of utility hackathons cut across key
  development areas, such as [domestic
violence](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/01/22/domestic-violence-hackathon-smartphone-lifesaver), [water
quality and
  access](http://www.scribd.com/doc/97458967/Water-Hackathon-Lessons-Learned) and
[sanitation](http://www.sanitationhackathon.org/).
* **Apps Challenges and Competitions.** Competitions are similar to
  hackathons, but typically emphasize competitive elements with prizes
  and/or recognition awarded by a judging panel. The rules of the
  competition specify the products or applications considered eligible
  to meet the sponsor's goals. Examples include the [Open Data
  Challenge](http://opendatachallenge.org/), [Apps for Development](http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com), [Apps
for Climate](http://data.worldbank.org/developers/app-competitions/apps-for-climate-winners) and
  the [Food Security Open Data Challenge](http://blog.usaid.gov/2012/05/food-security-open-data-challenge).
* **Prototype Funds.** A partnership-driven process to connect
  well-developed utility app and data usage projects (i.e., those at the
  post-redesign/re-development stage, through prior mentorship and
  feedback) to angel investor-type funding to build out and deploy
  scalable models. An example of partnership-driven engagement is the
  [Africa News Innovation Challenge](http://africannewschallenge.org/).

## Stage 4: Further Development {#stage-4}

Once the Open Data initiative is firmly established, engagement
strategies focus on ensuring that the initiative remains sustainable.
This can mean reinforcing the efforts of earlier stages, propagating the
initiative to other levels of government (from national to subnational
or vice versa) and supporting data user communities both locally and
nationally. The following are examples of programs and activities that
advocate user sponsorship, fostering or participation to help sustain
initiatives:

* **Code for \[Your Country\].** This is a partnership-driven, six-month
  Code Fellowship program, which collaboratively integrates top civic
  coders into government ministries to deploy coding skills to improve
  public service delivery, and into media and civil society
  organizations to strengthen the creation of data-driven content,
  products and services for mass public consumption, analysis and use.
  This initiative also improves transparent, accountable governance by
  supporting the identification and opening of demand-driven, actionable
  data and strengthening both data-driven analysis and decision-making
  at all levels. Examples of partnership-driven engagement include
  [Code4Kenya](http://www.code4kenya.org/), [CodeforAfrica](http://www.codeforafrica.org/), [Code for South
Africa](http://code4sa.org/) and
  [Code for Nepal](http://www.codefornepal.org/).
* **International and Regional Open Data Conferences.** These
  conferences are sponsored by different organizations and held around
  the world. They offer learning opportunities for both data providers
  and consumers and connect affiliated communities of practice. Examples
  include sessions at the first and second [International Open
  Government Data Conferences](http://www.data.gov/communities/conference), [Open Government Conference in
  Moscow](http://xn--e1aajfpcds8ay4h.xn--80abeamcuufxbhgound0h9cl.xn--p1ai/en/) and the first and second [Regional
Conferences on Open
  Data for Latin America and the Caribbean](http://confdatosabiertos.uy/home).
* **Open Data Communities.** Organized user communities can provide
  sustained support and engagement over the long term. They can be
  locally based or part of international consortia. Examples include
  [Hacks.Hacker chapters](http://hackshackers.com/resources/join/),
[GDGroups](https://developers.google.com/groups/directory/), [ODI Nodes](http://theodi.org/nodes), [OKFN
  Chapters](https://okfn.org/network/) and [Data Cafes](http://www.meetup.com/Cafes-de-DATA/).
