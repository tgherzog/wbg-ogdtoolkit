title: Open Data Essentials
---

This section of the toolkit provides a summary of the essential elements
of open government data, starting with its definition, and giving
real life examples of how Open Data is made available, and how it has
been put into practice.

Open Data Defined {#definition}
=================

The term "Open Data" has a [very precise meaning](http://opendefinition.org). Data or content is open if anyone is free to use, re-use or redistribute it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and openness.

There are two dimensions of data openness: 

1. The data must be **legally open**, which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions.

2. The data must be **technically open**, which means they must be published in electronic formats that are [machine readable and preferably non-proprietary](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/appendices/file-formats),
so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions. To make Open Data easier to find, most organizations create and manage [Open Data catalogs](essentials.html#examples).

## Open Data Licenses ## {#licenses}

Organizations and governments use Open Data licenses to clearly explain the conditions under which their data may be used. Many licenses include both a summary version, intended to convey the most important concepts to all users, and a detailed version that provides the complete legal foundation. Examples include:

* <span></span>Standard, re-usable licenses designed to provide consistent and broadly recognized terms of use; for instance, [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org), particularly
[CC-By](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) and [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
as well as the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/). Associating data with CC0 is essentially the same as placing it in the public domain.

* <span></span>Governments and international organizations that have developed bespoke licenses, such as the
[UK Open Government License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/), [The World Bank Terms of Use](http://data.worldbank.org/summary-terms-of-use) and the
[French Government License Ouverte](http://www.scribd.com/doc/69411439/French-PSI-Re-Use-Licence-Licence-Ouverte-Open-Licence-ENG).

Standard licenses can offer several advantages over bespoke licenses, including greater recognition among users, increased interoperability, and greater ease of compliance.

Examples of Open Data {#examples}
=============================


Open Data initiatives can be organized at different levels and often overlap jurisdictions.
Country-level initiatives feature data at the national level and below, and are often federated, which means
that they aggregate various sources of data at a single location. City and subnational
initiatives are similar in design but with a smaller scope. Individual agencies or sectors may have their own data
with a specific thematic focus. Other sources may contain specific kinds of data, such as statistical indicators,
geospatial data or microdata, such as business and household surveys.

Country initiatives are usually organized at the national level or below; city initiatives have a smaller scope; and agency data is often focused on a theme.

Following are some examples of Open Data at national, state or individual agency levels and for specific subjects. These
lists are not intended to be complete, as the total number of official Open Data initiatives runs well into the hundreds.
More examples can be found at [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/) and the [Open Data

Uses of Open Data {#uses}
=================

For Open Data to have impact and value, it must be put to use. Hence, making data usable is the core component of a
successful Open Data initiative. Usable data frequently have
[complete metadata](supply.html).

When Open Data is used for new products or services, it can increase data demand -- and drive the release of more datasets and improvements in data quality.
{: .pullquote :}

Two indicators of a successful Open Data initiative are when developers harness Open Data to produce new and valuable
products and services, or when they integrate Open Data into existing products and services. In an ideal scenario, this
leads to a "virtuous cycle," where new products increase [demand for Open Data](demand.html), which
catalyzes the release of more datasets, the development of new applications and so forth. A similarly patterned cycle
can lead to improvements in data quality; that is, as users raise questions and provide feedback on data they are trying
to use, data providers have an opportunity to improve metadata and other background information.

The following list includes examples of applications built on Open Data, grouped by subject. Many were developed for
competitions, hackathons or other [demand-side activities](demand.html) to promote the use of Open Data
for specific purposes.

### Environment

* [mWater](http://mwater.co/). A free suite of tools that uses GPS, cloud-based computing and mobile technology to
  create an integrated approach to managing water and sanitation services and preventing waterborne diseases and their
  impacts on communities.

* [Save the Rain](http://save-the-rain.com/SR2/). This app shows users how they can help reduce the impact of the
  alarming worldwide drop in annual rainfall predicted by The World Bank. Using maps and a novel "rooftop rainwater
  harvesting" approach, users estimate the amount of rainwater they can potentially save each year.

* [Ecofacts](http://www.jengibre.com.ar/ecofacts/). A small app that provides information about energy consumption and
  climate change, and how their effects on the environment can be influenced by citizens and communities.

### Budget and Spending

* [OpenSpending](http://www.openspending.org/). This app tracks government financial
  transactions worldwide and presents them in useful, engaging formats that appeal to a variety of users, from schoolchildren to data geeks. It features an open database of financial information; a
  community of users and contributors; and a set of open resources with technical, fiscal and political data.

* [Moldova BOOST](http://moldova.wb-boost.org/). This app collects and compiles from national treasury systems detailed
  data on Moldovan public expenditures and presents them in a simple, user-friendly format.

* [African Budget Data
  Explorer](http://twaweza.org/uploads/flash/budget-visualization-000/Twaweza.html#/home/viewType=Bubbles&split=Function&spending=Actual&year=2010-11).
  Using an "explorable" time series of visualizations of African budgets, this initiative enables users to "follow the
  money," unpack and understand budget priorities, inform election priorities and voice their opinions to ensure services
  are responsive to budgets.

### Health and Education

* [CheckMySchool](http://www.checkmyschool.org/main-page). In an effort to improve public education
  services, this monitoring program combines digital technology and community mobilization to promote accountability and transparency. It provides easy access to information and a
  platform for feedback, and helps citizens and government officials collaboratively resolve education issues.

* [Merge of HealthFacility](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1iBYvn8Cu-cpPDB2M4rpKhFIobfUlcycIGEo1E-4#map:id=3). A health facilities location
  application from the Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI) at National Information Technology Agency (NITA).

### Public Service Delivery

* [Spikes Cavell](http://www.spikescavell.net/default.aspx). An organization that equips decision-makers in higher
education and the public sector with the tools they need to reduce costs, increase transparency and benchmark
performance to improve procurement of goods and services. Its platform addresses incomplete or inappropriately
classified data or data distributed across partially integrated systems by transforming it into business intelligence.

* [Elgin (UK street works)](http://www.elgin.org.uk/). Roadworks Information Unlimited delivers real-time access to
information on road repair and construction for local authorities, motorways and truck routes across England and Wales
via websites, navigation systems and mobile devices. Users can view where and when road work is taking place and who is
responsible and assess transportation impacts.

* [PoliceUK](http://www.police.uk/). This app enables citizens to engage with police and promotes community activism in
support of crime prevention. It provides snapshots of street-level crime occurrences and outcomes, by category, using
maps and data from local policing teams and beat meetings.

### Open Government

* [Civic Commons](http://commons.codeforamerica.org/apps). An information product that helps governments and
institutions share knowledge, solutions and best practices to make better use of technology and advance Open Data and
Open Government. It supports a community of civic technologists by sharing not only a repository of government and civic
apps and information, but also its application code.

* [Socrata Open Data Applications](http://pinterest.com/socrata/open-data-applications/). A repository of examples that
demonstrate how Open Data is enabling civic applications.

* [GotToVote!](http://gottovote.co.ke/).  A data-driven tool to help citizens decipher and act on news-related issues by
showing how national events, such as elections, affect them personally. Built as a Code4Kenya data journalism project,
the tool provides citizens with local election results contextualized with information about community trends and
reports on irregularities.
  

### Other

* [BrightScope](http://www.brightscope.com/about/plan-management-dashboard/). This tool brings transparency to opaque
markets by allowing employers, employees and others to benchmark its benefit plans to those of a customized peer group
of competitor companies. It automatically collects key financial data for analytics and primarily operates in two major
segments: Retirement plans and wealth management.

* [DataViva](http://dataviva.info/). With more than 100 million interactive visualizations, this tool opens government
data -- including exports, locations and occupations -- for the entire formal sector of the Brazilian economy and
creates a foundation for dialog between public and private sectors.

* [Machine Readability Project](http://opendataimpactmap.org/usecases.html#MachineReadabilityProject). Includes examples of open data use in low to lower-middle income countries that use machine-readable open data. These use cases were developed as part of the Open Data Impact Map.


Open Data Online Learning {#elearning}
=========================

The World Bank has developed a series of e-learning courses to provide knowledge
and skills to practitioners and users of open data. Each course in the series is
designed for a distinct user segment, and provides deep technical skills, extensive
examples and case studies, with an emphasis on open data in developing countries.

Three courses are currently available online:

1. [Open Data for Data Producers][elearning-producers] provides
   a broad overview of Open Data principles and best practices from the
   standpoint of a data producer, and empowers data managers and technical
   staff with the background and skills to contribute to the Open Data
   community. This course is primarily intended for managers and technical
   staff involved in the production, management, and curation of data,
   particularly within government ministries. It assumes no prior knowledge of
   Open Data or specific technical skills.
   Upon completion, users may take an online assessment
   test to obtain a completion certificate from the online platform.

2. [Open Data for Data Users][elearning-users] provides a broad
   overview of Open Data from a user standpoint, and empowers anyone to take full
   advantage of Open Data.  It is intended for anyone who wants to make better use
   of Open Data, including ordinary citizens, and assumes no prior knowledge of
   Open Data or technical skills.
   Upon completion, users may take an online assessment
   test to obtain a completion certificate from the online platform.

3. [Open Data for Policymakers][elearning-policymakers] provides a general
   overview of Open Data principles and best practices for public policymakers,
   with focus on the development and implementation of an Open Data program.
   It primarily intended for public policymakers in governments that are considering
   the establishment or expansion of an Open Data program, and assumes no prior knowledge
   of Open Data or technical skills. This course is much shorter than the other two, and
   provides no certificate option.

Courses are also available in standalone versions for running in low-bandwidth settings (final
assessments must still be taken online).
